# ToDo MERN Stack Application

Welcome to the **ToDo MERN Stack Application**! This is a full-stack To-Do application built with the **MERN** stack, which stands for **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React**, and **Node.js**. The application allows users to add, update, and delete tasks, providing a simple yet functional way to manage daily tasks.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Users can create new tasks with a title and description.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can update task details (e.g., title, description).
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks once they're completed or no longer needed.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed and displayed with a different style to differentiate them.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be fully responsive, offering a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, React Router, Bootstrap (for responsive design)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose for Object Data Modeling)
- **Deployment**: Heroku/Vercel (depending on preference)

## Project Structure
- **client/**: Contains the React application and frontend-related files.
  - `src/`: Includes components, routing, and styles.
  - `public/`: Public assets like `index.html` and icons.
- **server/**: Contains backend-related files such as routes, models, and controllers.
  - `models/`: Mongoose models for task schema.
  - `routes/`: API routes for handling CRUD operations.
  - `controllers/`: Logic for managing tasks.
  - `config/`: Configuration files, including MongoDB connection setup.
  
## How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12+)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (or use a cloud instance via MongoDB Atlas)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AZKY12/MERN.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for the backend:**
   Navigate to the `server/` directory and install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install dependencies for the frontend:**
   Navigate to the `client/` directory and install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up MongoDB:**
   - If you're using a local MongoDB instance, make sure MongoDB is running.
   - If you're using MongoDB Atlas, update the connection string in the backend `config/` files with your Atlas credentials.

5. **Start the server:**
   Navigate to the `server/` directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. **Start the client:**
   Navigate to the `client/` directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Environment Variables
Make sure to add a `.env` file in the `server/` directory with the following configuration:
```
MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
PORT=5000
```

## Usage

Once the server and client are running, you can:
- Visit the front-end at `http://localhost:3000` to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
- The backend API runs on `http://localhost:5000/api/tasks` to manage tasks.

## Future Enhancements
- User authentication (sign-up and login).
- Task due dates and reminders.
- Sorting and filtering tasks by date or status.
- Task prioritization (e.g., high, medium, low).

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
