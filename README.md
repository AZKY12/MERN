# MERN Stack Project

Welcome to the **MERN Stack Project** repository! This project is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It demonstrates the integration of front-end and back-end technologies to create a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Project Overview

This application showcases the implementation of CRUD operations with a dynamic React frontend, an Express.js server, and a MongoDB database. The project serves as an example of how to effectively use the MERN stack to build scalable and efficient web applications.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** Developed with React for an intuitive and responsive UI.
- **RESTful API:** Built using Express.js to handle API requests and routes.
- **Database Integration:** MongoDB for robust and scalable data storage.
- **Full CRUD Functionality:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for seamless data management.
- **State Management:** Utilized React hooks and state for dynamic user interactions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AZKY12/MERN.git
   cd MERN
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   For both the server and client directories, install the required packages:  
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**  
   Create a `.env` file in the server directory and add the following:  
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB Connection String>
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. **Run the Application**  
   Open two terminals:
   - Terminal 1: Start the server
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm start
     ```
   - Terminal 2: Start the client
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm start
     ```

5. **Access the Application**  
   Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
